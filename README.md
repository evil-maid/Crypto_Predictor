# Crypto_Predictor
The objective of this project is to predict if tomorrow Bitcoin will close higher or lower than today.

In order to achieve this, I will initially try using closing prices and trading volumes up to today. In a later phase, I will incorporate the evolution of other cryptocurrencies, the Nasdaq index and gold valuations.

In the final phase, I will try to make predictions on other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Cardano.
